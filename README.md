## Starting the Chat App Server

To start the Chat App, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Server Folder:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you have the Chat App server code located. You can use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

    ```shell
    cd path/to/your/server/folder
    ```

2. **Run the Server:** Once you're inside the server folder, run the server using the `node` command followed by the name of the main server file, which is usually `index.js`. Enter the following command:

    ```shell
    node index.js
    ```

   This command will start the server and initiate the necessary processes to make your Chat App operational.

3. **Server Initialization:** As the server starts, you should see initialization messages in the terminal, indicating that the server is up and running. It might also display any relevant log information or errors, so make sure to keep an eye on the terminal output.

4. **Access the Chat App:** Once the server is successfully started, you can access the Chat App through a web browser or a dedicated client, depending on the nature of your application. Usually, you'll be able to access it by typing the appropriate URL in your browser's address bar.

That's it! You've successfully started the Chat App server and are ready to facilitate seamless conversations between users.
